First and foremost, we extend our sincerest gratitude to our mentors, Bram De Cooman and Sonny Achten, whose continuous support has been invaluable throughout this academic year. Their deep insights and constructive feedback have profoundly shaped this work, providing a strong foundation for our exploration and discovery. We would also like to thank ourselves for our dedication and perseverance in this process. It was our combined efforts and commitment that brought this thesis to fruition. We faced numerous challenges, but together, we navigated through them all with resilience and determination. Finally, we thank Prof. Johan Suykens for promoting this thesis, the assessors for reading this work and others for providing us with encouragement and support throughout our research.
